# Allow me to share intriguing insights derived from the Spotify Youtube Data Analysis:

ðŸ“Œ The artist with the highest number of views is Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, amassing a staggering 10.23 billion views. Following closely are Macklemore & Ryan Lewis in second place with 10.12 billion views, and finally, with 10 billion views, we have BTS securing the third position.

ðŸ“Œ BTS takes the crown as the most liked artist with a whopping 14 million likes. Following closely behind is Blackpink in second place. In the realm of streams, Post Malone claims the first position with 1.2 billion streams, closely trailed by Ed Sheeran with 1.74 billion streams.

ðŸ“Œ Album type emerges as the most popular category, with an astonishing 1.148762e+12 views, representing 75% of the total data. This prevalence surpasses that of compilation and single types.

ðŸ“Œ "Album Vida" is the most liked album, accumulating 120 million likes. "See You Again" and "The Heist" secure the second and third positions, respectively, with 80 million and 74 million views.

ðŸ“Œ "BE" stands as the most commented album, followed by "Map of the Soul." Interestingly, a higher number of comments implies a lesser-known album. However, "Vida" defies this trend by amassing higher likes while also being the most commented song, garnering a positive response.

ðŸ“Œ A correlation between speechiness and tempo is evident. Songs with faster tempos tend to exhibit a higher level of speechiness.

ðŸ“Œ Songs with a higher level of speechiness often possess a lower level of instrumentalness. This phenomenon arises due to the emphasis on lyrics and vocal delivery in spoken word or rap, while instrumental music leans towards the musical elements.
