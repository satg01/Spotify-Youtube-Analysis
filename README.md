## Project Highlights

ðŸ“Œ **Data Preparation:** Rigorously cleaned and prepared the dataset, ensuring data quality and integrity for robust analysis.

ðŸ“Œ **Initial Exploration:** Engaged in initial data exploration during EDA to gain a deep understanding of variables and distributions.

ðŸ“Œ **Effective Cleaning:** Employed advanced data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring accuracy in analysis.

ðŸ“Œ **Data Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visualizations, revealing hidden trends in Spotify and YouTube data.

ðŸ“Œ **Meaningful Conclusions:** Derived insights to shed light on artist popularity, likes, views, streams, album types, and correlations between variables.

## Insights

From the Spotify and YouTube Data Analysis, several intriguing insights emerged:

ðŸ“Œ The artist "Macklemore & Ryan Lewis" garnered a remarkable 10.23 billion views, securing the top spot. "Justin Bieber" followed closely with 10.12 billion views, while "BTS" held third place with 10 billion views.

ðŸ“Œ "BTS" emerged as the most liked artist, amassing an impressive 14 million likes. "Blackpink" secured the second position in likes. In terms of streams, "Post Malone" led with 1.2 billion streams, closely followed by "Ed Sheeran" with 1.74 billion streams.

ðŸ“Œ The dominant album type was "Album," accounting for 75% of the data, surpassing compilations and singles.

ðŸ“Œ The album "Album Vida" garnered the highest number of likes at 120 million. "See You Again" and "The Heist" followed with 80 million and 74 million likes, respectively.

ðŸ“Œ "Album BE" stood out as the most commented album, along with "Map of the Soul." Interestingly, a higher number of comments correlated with lesser-known albums. However, "Vida" defied this trend, accumulating higher likes and comments, signaling a positive response.

ðŸ“Œ A correlation existed between speechiness and tempo, with faster tempos typically associated with higher speechiness.

ðŸ“Œ Songs with higher speechiness often displayed lower instrumentalness, indicating an emphasis on lyrics and vocal delivery, as seen in spoken word or rap genres.
